# spacey
2D space sim game
 * Uses pygame

# top priority
#  *get on orbit looking solid
#  *parallax
#  *infinite zoom for vector drawings
#  *icons
#  *start on a board
#  *sidebar options
#  *provide zoom based icons
#  *define atmosphere parameters for each planet object thing
#  *differentiate between inertial and earth relative velocity 
#  *make moon horzon work like earth horizon view for propulsive landing 
#  *optionally scale the rocket with zoom
#  *j2 effects for asteroids
#  *rendezvous problem
#  *add a zoom that includes landing point
#  *make zooms slick rather than cheap
#  * make boards

# fix time zoom to have more options
#  * Pause
# add boards
# Zoom and mult-screen
#   * Click zoom to
#   * split screen into 2 screens 
# make display not jittery
# add lift and drag vector
# reentry attitude dynamics
# move reentry flap
# stage separation model
# cubic earth gravity field
# make interpolation smooth
# compute the angle of attack
# make vehicle move relative to altitude in horizon view
# change parent body for reference
# switch when reaching sphere of influence of new body
# add propellant for attitude control
# add 3-view 
# add sun and interplanetary
# make read out better
# draw a line to aries and aquarius
# Draw Earth land shadows
# slow the rate of change of the orbit
# Draw vector to the sun
# Draw vector to the moon
# add arrows to various planets and features
# add a ground station
# add the sun
# add display for time sun
# switch to trim thrusters
# @todo display sim time versus real time
# make a board, one that teaches something
#  * reach a target orbit
#  * stay in communication with a sat
# Amazing space pictures
#  * Earth and Moon from magellan
#  * Saturn from Gailleo leaving
# add heating indicators
# add flight path angles
# add separation feature
# allow controlling of multiple stages
# add parachutes
# propagation of 3rd body needs to be added to predictor


# Fancify the following
# altitude marker
# make navigation optional
